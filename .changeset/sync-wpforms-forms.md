Adds a WordPress form-sync feature: `lps form list/pull/push` on the CLI, backed by new REST routes under `loopress/v1/forms` on Loopress Full (Light stays ACF+SEO only). The plugin side introduces a generic `FormProvider` abstraction, mirroring the existing snippet sync (Code Snippets/WPCode), with WPForms as the first supported plugin; more WordPress form plugins can be added as additional providers later. Forms are addressed by numeric id (no ACF-style stable key), pulled/pushed as one `<id>-<slug>.json` file per form, with orphan cleanup on pull and the same PUT-then-404-fallback-to-create dance as `lps snippet push`.
