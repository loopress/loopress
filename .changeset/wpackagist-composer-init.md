Add `lps composer init`, which scaffolds a composer.json wired to WPackagist (repository, `composer/installers`, installer-paths) so WordPress.org plugins and themes can be added and installed through Composer instead of the native plugin API.

`lps composer pull` now also pulls `composer.json` (previously only `composer.lock`), backed by a new `GET loopress/v1/composer/json` endpoint on the WordPress plugin, so local composer.json stays in sync with packages added or removed through the Loopress admin page.
