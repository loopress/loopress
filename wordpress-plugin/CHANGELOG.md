# @loopress/wordpress-plugin

## 2026.7.6

### Patch Changes

- 31a82f6: The WordPress plugin now builds two editions from the same codebase: Loopress Light (`loopress-light.zip`, wordpress.org) keeps snippet synchronization (Code Snippets / WPCode); Loopress Full (`loopress-full.zip`, loopress.dev only) adds Composer dependency management (install, remove, audit, diagnostics, CLI sync) on top. Loopress Light contains no Composer code, even inactive; Loopress Full fully replaces Loopress Light on activation, both editions never run side by side. REST routes are unchanged (`loopress/v1/snippets*` and `loopress/v1/composer*`, the latter only present in Loopress Full), so existing CLI versions keep working.

## 2026.7.5

### Patch Changes

- 887b59f: Fixed all errors reported by the WordPress Plugin Check tool: escaped dynamic exception messages across the Composer and snippet provider services, added the missing `ABSPATH` direct-access guard in `loopress.php`, removed the tracked `assets/.gitkeep` hidden file (the `prebuild` script now creates the directory itself), and bumped the readme's "Tested up to" header to 7.0.

## 2026.7.4

### Patch Changes

- a85959e: Fix two bugs in the Code Snippets provider: `deleteSnippet()` was missing the leading slash required by `WP_REST_Server::dispatch()`, so `DELETE /wp-json/loopress/v1/snippets/{id}` always failed with "Snippet not found" instead of deleting anything. Separately, `getSnippets()`/`getSnippet()` returned trashed snippets indistinguishably from active ones (Code Snippets' own REST API doesn't filter them out), causing `lps snippet pull` to re-import a snippet the user had just deleted from wp-admin.

## 2026.7.3

### Patch Changes

- 9a8f6b5: Removed `PluginService`, `PluginController`, and the `loopress/v1/plugins*` REST routes. Plugin management now relies entirely on WordPress core's native `wp/v2/plugins` REST API, which the Loopress CLI calls directly.

## 2026.7.2

### Patch Changes

- 3f04ab4: Replace md5 hash function by native hash function with sha256
- 13c5fb9: Add tab on the UI and diagnostics panel
- 1dc1228: Unify snippet route

## 2026.7.0

### Minor Changes
